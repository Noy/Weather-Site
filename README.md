# Weather-Site

This is a small little project that I made when learning PHP.

Thought it would be cool to share on here.

NOTE:

This barely uses an API, it is based on getting a certain city through the link of the website.

Not really recommended, for many reasons. In a nutshell, if they change one thing, it breaks the entire site.

Getting a real API is much better and recommended. Again, it's just a little demo I thought I'd share here as it has some CSS and Bootstrap elements too.

Enjoy!
