# Weather-Site

This is a small little project that I made when learning PHP.

Thought it would be cool to share on here.

NOTE:

This barely uses an API, it is based on getting a certain city through the link of the website.

Not really recommended, for many reasons. In a nutshell, if they change one thing, it breaks the entire site.

Getting a real API is much better and recommended. Again, it's just a little demo I thought I'd share here as it has some CSS and Bootstrap elements too.

Enjoy!

P.s. It actually uses the same thing as my "Weather App" made with swift, just incase you want to check it out.
